Impacket is a collection of Python classes for working with network protocols, it provides a number of useful tools for pentesters and system administrators. Here is a list of the main Impacket tools available for Linux:

	smbexec.py: A tool for executing commands on a remote Windows host using SMB.

	psexec.py: A tool for executing commands on a remote Windows host using the PSExec service.

	wmiexec.py: A tool for executing commands on a remote Windows host using the Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) service.

	atexec.py: A tool for executing commands on a remote Windows host using the Task Scheduler service.

	smbserver.py: A tool for creating a SMB server that can be used to capture SMB authentication credentials.

	smbclient.py: A tool for connecting to SMB shares and performing various tasks such as uploading and downloading files.

	rpcclient.py: A tool for connecting to Windows servers and performing various tasks such as enumerating users, groups, and shares.

	dcomexec.py: A tool for executing commands on a remote Windows host using the DCOM protocol.

	winrmexec.py: A tool for executing commands on a remote Windows host using the Windows Remote Management (WinRM) service.

	mssqlclient.py: A tool for connecting to Microsoft SQL Server databases and performing various tasks such as enumerating databases, tables, and users.

Note: Some of these tools might not be available for Linux as they require Windows specific features and services.

Sure, I'd be happy to explain each of the Impacket tools in more detail:

	smbexec.py: This tool allows you to execute commands on a remote Windows host using SMB. It works by first establishing a connection to the target host using SMB and then uploading a payload to the host. The payload is executed using a combination of the PsExec and WMI services, which allows you to execute the command with administrative privileges.

	psexec.py: This tool allows you to execute commands on a remote Windows host using the PsExec service. It works by uploading a payload to the target host and then executing the payload using the PsExec service. The PsExec service is a Windows executable that allows you to execute commands on remote systems.

	wmiexec.py: This tool allows you to execute commands on a remote Windows host using the Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) service. It works by uploading a payload to the target host and then executing the payload using the WMI service. The WMI service is a Windows service that allows you to execute commands on remote systems.

	atexec.py: This tool allows you to execute commands on a remote Windows host using the Task Scheduler service. It works by creating a scheduled task on the target host that runs the payload. The Task Scheduler service is a Windows service that allows you to schedule tasks to run at a specified time.

	smbserver.py: This tool allows you to create a SMB server that can be used to capture SMB authentication credentials. It works by listening for incoming SMB connections and then capturing the authentication credentials used to establish the connection.

	smbclient.py: This tool allows you to connect to SMB shares and perform various tasks such as uploading and downloading files. It works by connecting to a remote SMB share and then allowing you to perform various file operations on the share.

	rpcclient.py: This tool allows you to connect to Windows servers and perform various tasks such as enumerating users, groups, and shares. It works by connecting to a remote Windows host and then using the Remote Procedure Call (RPC) protocol to perform various tasks.

	dcomexec.py: This tool allows you to execute commands on a remote Windows host using the DCOM protocol. It works by uploading a payload to the target host and then executing the payload using the DCOM protocol. The DCOM protocol is a Windows protocol that allows you to execute commands on remote systems.

	winrmexec.py: This tool allows you to execute commands on a remote Windows host using the Windows Remote Management (WinRM) service. It works by connecting to a remote Windows host and then using the WinRM service to execute the payload. The WinRM service is a Windows service that allows you to execute commands on remote systems.

	mssqlclient.py: This tool allows you to connect to Microsoft SQL Server databases and perform various tasks such as enumerating databases, tables, and users. It works by connecting to a remote Microsoft SQL Server database and then using the SQL protocol to perform various tasks.

Note: The availability and functionality of these tools may vary depending on the version of Impacket and the target operating system. Additionally, some of these tools may require administrative privileges on the target system in order to function correctly.
