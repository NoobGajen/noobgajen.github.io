### 2xx: Success
These codes indicate that the request was successfully received, understood, and accepted.
- **200 OK**: The request was successful.
- **201 Created**: The request was successful, and a resource was created.
- **202 Accepted**: The request has been accepted but not yet processed.
- **204 No Content**: The request was successful, but there is no content to send back.

---

### 3xx: Redirection
These codes indicate that further action is needed to complete the request.
- **301 Moved Permanently**: The resource has been permanently moved to a new URL.
- **302 Found**: The resource is temporarily located at a different URL.
  
  **Note**: If you see a **302** status code, it means the page is redirecting to another URL. This can sometimes hide important information. Check both the original and the redirected URLs for vulnerabilities. Tools like **Burp Suite** can capture this redirection to analyze both paths.
  
- **304 Not Modified**: The resource hasn't been modified since the last request.

### 4xx: Client Errors
These codes indicate that there was an issue with the request.
- **400 Bad Request**: The server could not understand the request due to malformed syntax.
  
  **Note**: A **400** error might mean the server is validating input strictly. Try sending different or malformed inputs to check for vulnerabilities like **SQL Injection** or **XSS**.

- **401 Unauthorized**: Authentication is required and has failed or has not been provided.
  
  **Note**: If you get a **401** error, it means authentication is required. In CTFs, you might need to brute-force credentials using tools like **Hydra** or try bypassing authentication using session cookies or tokens.

- **403 Forbidden**: The server understood the request but refuses to authorize it.
  
  **Note**: **403 Forbidden** means access is restricted. You can try changing HTTP methods (like from **GET** to **POST**) or modifying request headers. Sometimes, this can bypass the restriction. Also, directory brute-forcing might reveal files that are accessible.

- **404 Not Found**: The requested resource could not be found on the server.
  
  **Note**: **404 Not Found** doesn’t always mean the resource doesn’t exist. Use tools like **Gobuster** or **Dirb** to brute-force hidden directories or files. This often leads to discovering important information.

### 5xx: Server Errors
These codes indicate that the server failed to fulfill a valid request.
- **500 Internal Server Error**: A generic error occurred on the server.
  
  **Note**: **500 Internal Server Error** is often triggered when the server fails to handle an input. This is a sign that there could be vulnerabilities like **SQL Injection** or **Remote Code Execution (RCE)**. Try sending unexpected inputs or payloads to find an attack vector.

- **502 Bad Gateway**: The server, acting as a gateway, received an invalid response from the upstream server.
  
  **Note**: A **502** error usually means there’s an issue with communication between servers. Check if there are different subdomains or backend services that might have vulnerabilities.

- **503 Service Unavailable**: The server is temporarily unavailable, usually due to maintenance or overload.
  
  **Note**: When you see **503**, it could mean the service is down for maintenance. During this time, other endpoints or backup servers might still be online, which could have security flaws.
