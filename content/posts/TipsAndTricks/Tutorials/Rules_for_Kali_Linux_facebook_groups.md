## 1. Stay Focused on Learning & Skill Development:
This group is a knowledge hub for ethical hacking, cybersecurity, and Kali Linux.
✅ Ask questions, share knowledge, and help each other grow!
✅ All posts must be relevant to these topics.
🚫 Basic Kali errors? Ask in the Community Chat, not as a post.
💡 Tip: Search before asking! Many common issues are already discussed.

We’re here to learn, not to clutter the group with unnecessary posts.

## 2. Be Ethical – Hack with Honor:
Cybersecurity is about protecting, not harming. 🚀
🚫 No hacking requests for social media, emails, or personal accounts.
🚫 No discussions or sharing of pirated/copyrighted materials.
🚫 No fraudulent activities, scams, or illegal content.
⚠️ Warning: Anyone engaging in scams, fraud, or unauthorized activity will be banned permanently.

Ethical hacking means responsibility. Let's uphold it!

## 3. No Buying, Selling, or Paid Promotions 💰🚫
🚫 No transactions, no selling or buying. Because Facebook does not provide a way to track transactions, so we do not allow any financial activities in this group.
🚫 No short links, paid promotions, or advertisements.  
🚫 No selling of courses, services, or tools.  

✔️ If unsure about your post, ask a Moderator first.  
This group is for learning, not a marketplace. Let's keep it pure and scam-free!

## 4. Guidelines for Making Posts About Errors ⚙️
Want quick and useful solutions? Make your error post clear and detailed!  
✅ Describe the issue clearly.  
✅ Share a screenshot (if possible).  
✅ Mention the tool name & source link (if it’s not in Kali repository).  
✅ List the steps you tried before asking for help.  
🚫 Posts like “Kali not working. Help!” will NOT be approved.

💡 A well-explained question gets a well-explained answer!  

## 5. Respect & Professionalism 🤝
💙 This group thrives on respect and support.  
🚫 No bullying, hate speech, or offensive behavior.  
🚫 No harassment, personal attacks, or discrimination.  
⚠️ Immediate ban for violators — zero tolerance for toxicity!  

Let’s make this a safe space for everyone!

## 6. English Only for Clear Communication 🌍
✅ To keep discussions Understandable to everyone, all posts must be in English.
🚫 Posts in other languages may not be approved.

This helps members from all over the world understand and join the discussion.

## 7. Privacy & Security First 🔒
🔒 Privacy is a priority.  
🚫 No sharing of phone numbers, emails, or sensitive details.  
🚫 No unsolicited DMs or friend requests.  
⚠️ Violating privacy rules = Removal from the group.

Keep your data safe and respect others' privacy!

## 8. Respect Admins & Moderators 👑
