      <description>The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt, which is a hexdump of a file that has been repeatedly compressed. For this level it may be useful to create a directory under /tmp in which you can work. Use mkdir with a hard to guess directory name. Or better, use the command “mktemp -d”. Then copy the datafile using cp, and rename it using mv (read the manpages!)</description>

      <description>The password for the next level is stored in `/etc/bandit_pass/bandit14` and can only be read by user `bandit14`. For this level, you don’t get the next password, but you get a private SSH key that can be used to log into the next level. **Note:** `localhost` is a hostname that refers to the machine you are working on.</description>

      <description>The credentials for the next level can be retrieved by submitting the password of the current level to a port on localhost in the range 31000 to 32000. First find out which of these ports have a server listening on them. Then find out which of those speak SSL and which don’t. There is only 1 server that will give the next credentials, the others will simply send back to you whatever you send to it.</description>

      <description>There are 2 files in the homedirectory: `passwords.old and passwords.new`. The password for the next level is in `passwords.new` and is the only line that has been changed between `passwords.old and passwords.new`</description>

      <description>The password for the next level is stored in a file `readme` in the homedirectory. Unfortunately, someone has modified `.bashrc` to log you out when you log in with SSH.</description>

      <description>To gain access to the next level, you should use the `setuid` binary in the homedirectory. Execute it without arguments to find out how to use it. The password for this level can be found in the usual place `(/etc/bandit_pass)`, after you have used the setuid binary.</description>

      <description>There is a setuid `binary` in the homedirectory that does the following: it makes a connection to localhost on the port you specify as a commandline argument. It then reads a line of text from the connection and compares it to the password in the previous level `bandit20`. If the password is correct, it will transmit the password for the next level `bandit21`.</description>

      <description>A daemon is listening on port 30002 and will give you the password for bandit25 if given the password for bandit24 and a secret numeric 4-digit pin code. There is no way to retrieve the pin code except by going through all the 10000 combinations, called brute-forcing.</description>
