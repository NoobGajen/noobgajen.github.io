What do you do?
I’m a student of Bachelor in Information Technology with a passion for cybersecurity, focusing on red teaming, blue teaming, bug bounties, and CTF challenges. My goal is to specialize in both offensive and defensive security techniques to become a professional ethical hacker. I actively participate in CTFs on platforms like TryHackMe and HackTheBox. Additionally, I’m learning programming languages such as Bash, Python, PHP, C, HTML, and JavaScript to better understand applications from a developer&rsquo;s perspective and secure them by identifying vulnerabilities before malicious actors can exploit them.">
